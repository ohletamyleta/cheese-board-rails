# Cheese Board

This is an app that allows the user to input their favorite cheeses, create wines to pair with them, and review the cheeses in the database.  This is a portfolio project for the Phase 3 Rails section at Flatiron School.

### Getting Started

To get started with the app, clone the repo then install the needed gems:

` $ bundle install`

Next, migrate the database:

` $ rake db:migrate`

Then run the app in a local server:

` $ rails server`

Navigate to:

localhost:3000
